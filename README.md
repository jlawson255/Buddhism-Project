    <h2>What is Buddhism?</h2>
    <p>Buddhism is a spiritual tradition founded by Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha) in the 5th-6th century BCE. It teaches that by understanding the nature of suffering and practicing mindfulness, compassion, and meditation, one can attain enlightenment and freedom from the cycle of rebirth (samsara).</p>

      <li>The Four Noble Truths</li>
      <li>The Eightfold Path</li>
      <li>Mindfulness and Meditation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Choose Buddhism?</h2>
    <p>Buddhism offers a practical path to inner peace and freedom from suffering. In today's fast-paced and stressful world, its teachings provide mental clarity, emotional balance, and compassionate living.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Focus on self-awareness and mental health</li>
      <li>Non-theistic and open to interpretation</li>
      <li>Minimal rituals and no blind faith required</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="compare">
    <h2>Comparing Religions</h2>
    <p><strong>Why Buddhism over Hinduism?</strong><br>
      While Hinduism has a rich spiritual heritage, its complex caste system and ritual obligations may feel limiting. Buddhism, by contrast, is more egalitarian and direct in its path to liberation.</p>
    <p><strong>Why Buddhism over Confucianism?</strong><br>
      Confucianism emphasizes social roles and duties, which can sometimes suppress individuality. Buddhism focuses on inner transformation and personal freedom beyond social constructs.</p>

  <section id="interactive">
    <h2>Discover the Path</h2>
    <p><em>Ask yourself:</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do I seek peace more than power?</li>
      <li>Do I want to understand suffering rather than escape it?</li>
      <li>Am I ready to observe and grow instead of control and conquer?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you answered yes, the path of the Buddha may be calling you.</p>

    <h2>Creative Reflection</h2>
    <p>This website was created as a creative expression for RELI 1330 to present Buddhism to those unfamiliar with it. The process involved distilling complex philosophical ideas into accessible language and crafting a clear visual and textual narrative.</p>
    <p>The design emphasizes simplicity and serenity to reflect Buddhist values of mindfulness and minimalism. Themes such as the individual journey to liberation, critique of rigid systems, and inner transformation connect directly to course themes such as identity, belief, and ritual.</p>
    <p>By contrasting Buddhism with Hinduism and Confucianism, the site highlights Buddhismâ€™s appeal to seekers of inner peace and autonomy, especially in a modern context where mental health and individual agency are crucial concerns.</p>
